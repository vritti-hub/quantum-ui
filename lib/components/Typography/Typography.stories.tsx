      <Typography variant='h1'>Taxing Laughter: The Joke Tax Chronicles</Typography>

      <Typography variant='body1' intent='muted' className='text-xl'>
        Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all day lounging on his throne. One
        day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='h2'>The King's Plan</Typography>

      <Typography variant='body1'>
        The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{' '}
        <span className='text-primary font-medium underline underline-offset-4'>a brilliant plan</span>: he would tax
        the jokes in the kingdom.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='blockquote'>
        "After all," he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair that they should pay for the privilege."
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='h3'>The Joke Tax</Typography>

      <Typography variant='body1'>
        The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the king was firm:
      </Typography>

      <ul className='my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2'>
        <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
        <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
        <li>3rd level of one-liners: 20 gold coins</li>
      </ul>

      <Typography variant='body1'>
        As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was one person who
        refused to let the king's foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='h3'>The People's Rebellion</Typography>

      <Typography variant='body1'>
        The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to tell jokes and puns again, and soon the
        entire kingdom was in on the joke.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='body1'>
        The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good laugh and always be careful of bad ideas.
